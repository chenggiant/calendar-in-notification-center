## User Guide

- Use the arrow buttons to go previous month or next month.
- Swipe up and down to go to the next and previous month.
- Swipe left to go back to the current month.


## Installation


### Option 1:

Download the [following zip file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dtyxw1n7g6ei1uj/Calendar-Widget.zip?dl=0) and double click the `Calendar.app`.



### Option 2:

Build the app and save it somewhere safe (not in the Application's folder, since you probably don't want to overwrite Apple's Calendar app!). Then you can add the "This Month" widget to your Notification Center.
