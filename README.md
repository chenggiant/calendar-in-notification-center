# Calendar

Mac Today widget showing a months calendar. It's simple, with no options. It uses your locale to determine whether your week starts on a Sunday (wrong) or Monday (correct).

## User guide

Swipe up and down to go to the next and previous month. Swipe left to go back to the current month.

## Installation

Build the app and save it somewhere safe (not in the Application's folder, since you probably don't want to overwrite Apple's Calendar app!). Then you can add the "This Month" widget to your Notificaton Centre.
